## Why should we work together?

I'm a Backend Developer with 4 years of experience in both startup and post-startup environments, and I'm excited about the opportunity to contribute to GitLab's authorization system. While I haven't directly worked with RBAC implementations before, my experience with Ruby on Rails APIs and microservices has given me a strong foundation in building scalable systems. Since late 2022, I've worked on a payments processing team where I've dealt with complex permission systems and user access controls, which has sparked my interest in diving deeper into authorization systems.

My experience with PostgreSQL, GitHub Actions CI/CD, Kubernetes, and Docker matches your tech stack, allowing me to hit the ground running. What particularly excites me about this role is the opportunity to work on enterprise-grade authorization systems. While I'm new to mature authorization systems, I'm eager to learn and contribute to building scalable solutions that give organizations complete control over their member access.

I'm particularly drawn to the opportunity to influence critical architecture decisions and establish conventions that will shape how the authorization feature grows. My experience with both startup and post-startup environments has taught me the importance of building systems that can scale while maintaining performance and security. I'm also excited about the potential to collaborate with the Anti-abuse team on security-focused features, as I have a strong security mindset and some light experience with secure coding practices.

While my primary focus is on backend development, I have some experience with TypeScript on the frontend, which could be valuable for cross-team collaboration. I'm not afraid to ask questions or seek help when needed, and I believe in the power of collaboration to build better solutions. I'm particularly impressed by GitLab's mission to enable everyone to contribute to software development, and I would be excited to be part of a team that's making this vision a reality.

I'd love the opportunity to bring my skills, enthusiasm for learning, and collaborative mindset to the GitLab team â€” let's connect and see how we can build great things together.
