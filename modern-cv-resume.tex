\section{Profile}
Software Engineer passionate about learning. Worked in a professional environment [within various roles] since 2019, but I've been coding and learning since I was 10. I am a team player - collaboration is second-nature to me. I can also really thrive under a solid team-lead who is willing to provide a direction for me to go. I've worked on IoT, B2B ERP, and now Payments, but I'm really looking to change it up again and expand my horizons.
