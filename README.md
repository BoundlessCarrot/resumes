# Resume Repository

This repository contains different versions of my professional resume, organized chronologically by year. Each year's directory contains multiple versions of the resume, allowing for easy tracking of changes and different formats used for various applications.

## Repository Structure

```
├── 2025/                    # Current year's resume versions
├── 2024/                    # 2024 resume versions
├── pre-2024/               # Resume versions from before 2024
└── README.md               # This file
```

## Version Control

Each resume version is named with the following format:
```
[Name]-[Position]_v[version]_[year]_fmt[format].pdf
```

For example:
- `Jordan_Streete-Software_Engineer_v3_2024_fmt1.pdf`
- `Jordan_Streete-Software_Engineer_v3_2024_fmt2.pdf`

This naming convention helps track:
- Different versions of the resume (v1, v2, etc.)
- The year the version was created
- Different formats used for various applications (fmt1, fmt2, etc.)

## Usage

This repository serves as a centralized location for:
1. Storing different versions of my resume
2. Tracking changes and improvements over time
3. Maintaining multiple formats for different job applications
4. Version control of resume content
