## Why should we work together?

I'm a Backend Developer with 4 years of experience in both startup and post-startup environments, and I'm looking to deepen my knowledge base while delivering engineering value, fresh perspectives, and heaps of curiosity to your team. Since late 2022 I've worked on a payments processing team, dealing with a Ruby on Rails API as well as a Ruby/Kafka microservices project. Both utilized PostgreSQL, GitHub Actions CI/CD, Kubernetes, Terraform, and Docker. Before that I spent some time at an IoT startup building their API in Python. I believe I'm well-placed to contribute to the company as much as I can.

That is not to say, however, that I will be stagnant in my skill level. I absolutely love learning and expanding the number of ways I can accomplish something, especially in code, and I'm excited to share the spoils of that curiosity with you. I am also not allergic to asking for help - collaboration is an important part of the toolbox, and I am happy to learn from and occasionally teach my colleagues something new.

I’d love the opportunity to bring my skills, curiosity, and collaborative mindset to the team — let’s connect and see how we can build great things together.
