## Why should we work together?

I'm a Backend Developer with 4 years of experience in both startup and post-startup environments, and I'm excited about the opportunity to contribute to Travelcircus's growing platform. My experience aligns perfectly with your needs - I've spent the last few years building and maintaining robust transactional APIs and microservices, working with technologies like PostgreSQL, message queues, and modern development practices. This makes me uniquely qualified to help build and extend your Platform Services and Booking Systems.

At Marley Spoon, I worked on a payments processing team where I developed and maintained APIs that handled thousands of transactions daily. I optimized database queries to improve performance, implemented robust error handling, and built systems that integrated with multiple payment service providers. This experience directly translates to the kind of work I'd be doing at Travelcircus - building scalable, reliable systems that power your booking platform.

I'm particularly drawn to Travelcircus's mission of creating unique travel experiences. My experience in both backend development and travel-related work (including my time in Paris) gives me a unique perspective on building systems that enhance the travel experience. I'm excited about the opportunity to work on a platform that brings joy to travelers while solving complex technical challenges.

I absolutely love learning and expanding my technical knowledge, and I'm excited to share that curiosity with your team. I'm not afraid to ask for help when needed - collaboration is an important part of my toolkit, and I'm happy to learn from and occasionally teach my colleagues something new. My experience working in fast-growing environments has taught me the importance of clear communication and teamwork in delivering high-quality products.

I'd love the opportunity to bring my skills, curiosity, and collaborative mindset to Travelcircus â€” let's connect and see how we can build great things together.
